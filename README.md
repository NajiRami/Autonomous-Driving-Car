## 🧠 About the Project  

This project aims to simulate an *Autonomous Driving Car* that can detect and locate **vehicles**, **pedestrians**, and **road objects** using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** — one of the fastest and most accurate object detection algorithms.  

🔍 The system processes each video frame, detects surrounding objects, and draws bounding boxes for real-time awareness.  

---

## 🚀 Features  

✅ Real-time *object detection* using YOLOv5  
✅ Detects *cars, pedestrians, traffic signs*, and more  
✅ Easy to *customize and retrain* with your own dataset  
✅ Visualizes *before & after predictions* 🖼

## ⚙ Installation  

```bash
git lfs install #⬅️If it's not installed in your machine.

# 1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NajiRami/Autonomous-Driving-Car.git

# 2️⃣ Navigate to the project directory
cd Autonomous-Driving-Car

# 3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎯 How It Works  

1. 🧩 Load YOLO model  
2. 🎥 Read input frames from camera or video  
3. 📦 Detect objects in each frame  
4. ✏ Draw bounding boxes and class labels  
5. 🚘 Display real-time output
